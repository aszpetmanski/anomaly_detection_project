IoT Anomaly Detection â€“ Isolation Forest & MLflow

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project simulates real-time anomaly detection in a manufacturing environment using IoT sensor data.
We use a Flask application to stream sensor readings, an Isolation Forest model for detecting anomalies, and MLflow to package and serve the model as a REST API.
The system is designed to be dynamic, meaning it automatically adapts to new datasets with different features after retraining.


ðŸš€ Features\
Synthetic IoT Data Simulation â€“ Gaussian-distributed data with injected anomalies.\
Real-time Streaming â€“ Flask endpoint sends one reading per second.\
Unsupervised Anomaly Detection â€“ Isolation Forest, no labels required.\
Dynamic Feature Handling â€“ Automatically adapts to new sensors.\
Model Serving via MLflow â€“ REST API for predictions.\
Anomaly Logging â€“ CSV file with timestamps, sensor readings, and scores.\
Retraining Pipeline â€“ Easy to adapt to new factories or conditions.\


ðŸ“‚ Running the Project\
This repository contains two complete execution flows:\
Run with Dataset v1 (Original) â€“\
Uses the original dataset with temperature, humidity, and sound_volume as features.\
Step-by-step instructions to run the system and check accuracy.\
Run with Dataset v2 (Retraining & Threshold) â€“\
Demonstrates retraining the model with different features (e.g., light exposure, vibration).\
Shows how to adjust threshold to reach 1.0 anomaly recall after retraining.\
